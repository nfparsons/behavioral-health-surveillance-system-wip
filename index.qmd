## Overview

Welcome to the development hub for the county's new **Behavioral Health Surveillance System (BHSS)**. This system is designed to leverage robust data collection, advanced geospatial analytics, and dynamic visualization tools to monitor, understand, and address critical behavioral health challenges within our community.

## Project Vision

To establish a sustainable, actionable, and geographically informed behavioral health surveillance system that:

* Identifies emerging trends and patterns in behavioral health outcomes.
* Pinpoints geographic disparities and areas of high need.
* Informs the development and evaluation of public health programs and policies.
* Facilitates collaboration among stakeholders across the county.
* Empowers community partners with accessible and relevant data.

## Key Phases of Development

This website will document our journey through the following key phases:

1.  **Foundational Planning & Needs Assessment:** Defining the scope, objectives, and identifying existing data sources and gaps.
2.  **Data Acquisition & Management:** Establishing secure data pipelines, cleaning protocols, and database infrastructure.
3.  **Geospatial Analytics & Visualization:** Applying advanced spatial analysis techniques and developing interactive dashboards.
4.  **Reporting, Dissemination & Evaluation:** Creating regular reports, sharing findings, and ensuring the system's ongoing utility and sustainability.

We anticipate integrating interactive Shiny applications to allow for dynamic data exploration and visualization, complementing the static reports and documentation provided here.

Stay tuned for updates as we progress through each phase!
